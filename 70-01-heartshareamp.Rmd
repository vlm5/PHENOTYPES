# [2022-09-29] In-Person HeartShare AMP

Status: Completed

## General Description and Notes

During the in-person meeting on September 29, 2022, we hoped to convey the potential size of the pool of HF participants across HeartShare Clinical Centers.

## Cohort

please query your site's EHR data to collect numbers and basic information about your site's total HFpatients whose data and images can be queried from the EHR.

Selection criteria: follow DTC guidelines to identify HF patients (all EFs) in the EHR 2016 onwards (ICD-10 implementation date)

-   Age: $\geq$ 18, if used age cut off at 30 as had been previously discussed just indicate that
-   Presence of ICD-10 Codes: 2 outpatient encounters or 1 inpatient (for list of codes see below)
-   No additional filtering criteria, if you are using any (e.g. BNP cut off value) please indicate that in your response
-   DON'T FILTER BASED ON EF, please tabulate instead

### ICD-10 Codes

```
I09.81,  I11.0,  I13.0,  I13.2,  I50.1,  
I50.20,  I50.21,  I50.22,  I50.23,  I50.30,  
I50.31,  I50.32,  I50.33,  I50.40,  I50.41,  
I50.42,  I50.43,  I50.810,  I50.811,  I50.812,  
I50.813,  I50.814,  I50.82,  I50.83,  I50.84,  
I50.89,  I50.9
```

## Table or Result Specs

We need the following data (age, sex, and race/ethnicity are most important, but EF would be great, especially to categorize into the types of HF [HFpEF, HFmrEF, HFrEF]). If you can, please document the source of the LVEF (from Echo? NLP extraction from notes?) :

-   Age: median, IQR, mean, SD, range
-   Sex: N (%)
-   Race/ethnicity: N (%)
-   LVEF (most recent LVEF): median, IQR, mean, SD, range.
-   Sub-Tabulate based on LVEF group into four categories, N (%): HFrEF (EF \< 40%), HFmrEF (EF 40-49%), HFpEF (EF $\geq$ 50%), or patients for whom discrete LVEF Not Available.
