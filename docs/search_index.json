Working closely with informatics and data science professionals across the consortium, the EHRI and DP WG will ensure that the processes for acquiring and integrating data – including extant cohorts, EHR, and imaging data – are sound, secure, effective, and adherent with the research protocols of HeartShare. 1.2 EHR Integration Purpose The goal is to functionally integrate clinical care data for HF patients and their comparator group from the HeartShare Clinical Centers (CCs). These data sets are not intended for discovery of novel HFpEF phenotypes. Rather they will be used to: Describe and characterize the scope, composition and ready availability of EHR data for HF patients across HeartShare Aid the identification and enrollment of HF and HFpEF patients with bespoke clinical features into the HeartShare Study if and when needed Provide a platform for the real-world application of EHR-based HFpEF phenotypes which can be used to find patient sub-populations and drive iterative phenotype validation and refinement. Resource for investigators interested in multi-site analyses (e.g., study the uptake of specific treatments, gather pilot data to support ancillary grants) 1.3 Whose EHR Records Are Collected and for What Time Span? Broadly speaking the EHR records that are included in the HeartShare data calls are for Heart Failure patients and their comparator groups from the HeartShare Clinical Centers (CC). For these cohorts, we aim to collect retrospective longitudinal data. In other words, we are looking to gather as complete a longitudinal picture of these patients’ HF journey as we can, even prior to the launch of the HeartShare study or even their HF diagnosis. Based on technical feasibility, analysis aims, and regulatory requirements the retrospective data set may be collected once (one time) or collected once then periodically updated (one time with “top offs”). In the latter case, the DP and EHRI WG in consultation with the HeartShare CCs will determine the adequate scope and frequency of the data set updates. It is also useful to highlight the two cohort categories below: 1.3.1 The Entire Pool of HF Patients with EHR Records This is a broad category and intended to include all HF patients and their appropriate comparator groups with EHR records at HeartShare CCs. Since this category is broad and includes current and past patients who are not HeartShare participants, the regulatory framework for collecting and analyzing their EHR data will depend on obtaining a waiver of HIPAA authorization from the local IRBs and privacy boards. 1.3.2 Patients Enrolled in HeartShare This category is a subset of the category above and includes patients who are enrolled into HeartShare studies via the Eureka platform. These participants provide informed consent and HIPAA authorization for sharing their EHR data, so the regulatory pathway for accrual and sharing of their health information is likely to be more permissive. The accrual of these patients will be ongoing and will include ongoing encounters with the HeartShare CC HF clinics; therefore, this group will likely require regular EHR data aggregation and “topping off” during their active participation in HeartShare studies. This category includes participants in the HeartShare HF Registry (previously referred to as the “light touch registry”), the HeartShare Deep Phenotyping Cohort (DPC), and their comparator groups. 1.4 What EHR Data Are in Scope? The data domains that will be included will be prioritized based on their relevance to the HeartShare scientific goals. Informed by the overall aims of HeartShare and the unfolding of the main studies, the DP and EHRI WG will work to define the EHR domains. The following diagram shows a high-level roadmap of the domains we will be seeking. Note that there will be domains (red) for which there may not be a clear pathway for mapping to the OMOP CDM. In addition to specifying the requirements, the DP and EHRI WG will set guidelines on the procedures for obtaining data from ancillary data sources where they reside. Furthermore, there may be a need to examine the pertinent vocabularies and propose additions where needed. (e.g., by working through the OHDSI community’s CDM Refresh Process.) This will offer an opportunity for the work in HeartShare to inform EHR-based phenotyping in the field in general. 1.5 How Will EHR Data Be Extracted and Prepared for Analysis? There will be two steps for data extraction and harmonization into a format amenable to uniform analysis across all HeartShare CCs. 1.5.1 Local EHR Query: Cohort Identification and Domain Selection. This step is highly variable and depends on the local EHR data stores within each CC. This step will rely on cohort definitions to identify the appropriate patients. 1.5.2 Extract, Transform, Load: Harmonization Using the OMOP CDM In this step, the exported records with the associated domain field values will be transformed into relational database tables that are concordant with the OHDSI OMOP Common Data Model (CDM). 1.6 Where Will the EHR Data Be Analyzed? The HeartShare DTC will work with the HeartShare CCs to develop appropriate data transfer agreements (DTA) that cover the different subsets of patient populations in the shared EHR data. Furthermore, all institutions whose investigators will require access to the data will need to sign a data use agreement (DUA). There are two workflows for data analysis. Scenario 1: local analysis because a DTA is not feasible for a given population or a DTA has not been signed yet, followed by pooling of analysis results Scenario 2: pooling of data into a central location managed by the HeartShare DTC followed by one central analysis "],["heartshare-retrospective-cohort-details.html", "2 HeartShare Retrospective Cohort Details 2.1 Cohort 2.2 OMOP Tables Usage", " 2 HeartShare Retrospective Cohort Details 2.1 Cohort As currently proposed, there will be two cohorts of HF patients whose records are to be included in the OMOP tables. This does not include their comparator groups yet as the cohort definition criteria for them is still being developed. 2.1.1 Historical HF Patients at CC 2.1.1.1 Selection criteria Selection criteria: follow DTC guidelines to identify HF patients (all EFs) in the EHR 2016 onwards (ICD-10 implementation date), namely: Age: \\(\\geq\\) 18, if used age cut off at 30 as had been previously discussed just indicate that Presence of ICD-10 Codes: 2 outpatient encounters or 1 inpatient (for list of codes see below) Please do not use any additional filtering criteria. If you are using any (e.g., BNP cut off value) please indicate that in your response to the DTC. 2.1.1.2 ICD-10 Codes I09.81, I11.0, I13.0, I13.2, I50.1, I50.20, I50.21, I50.22, I50.23, I50.30, I50.31, I50.32, I50.33, I50.40, I50.41, I50.42, I50.43, I50.810, I50.811, I50.812, I50.813, I50.814, I50.82, I50.83, I50.84, I50.89, I50.9 2.1.2 HF Patients Prospectively Enrolled in the HeartShare Study Patients in the HF arms of the HeartShare Study, both the HeartShare HF Registry and the HFpEF Deep Phenotyping Cohorts, are also to be included as they enroll in the study and provide informed consent and EHR authorization via the Eureka app. 2.2 OMOP Tables Usage All the tables are congruent with OMOP CDM v.5.3.1. Required tables are expected to be populated with the data and are listed in bold letters. Optional tables can be left empty for now are listed in gray. A link to the corresponding table definitions in the OMOP CDM is provided for each table. If possible, we ask that patient data for the tables are populated starting 10 years prior to the date patient qualified for the cohort (selection criteria looks in the EHR records starting with year 2016; If patient qualified in 2020, cohort should include patients’ data from 2010 onwards). We anticipate managing HeartShare cohorts by using OMOP CDM COHORT% tables. More information will follow. 2.2.1 Clinical Data Tables https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/cdm53.html#Clinical_Data_Tables PERSON OBSERVATION_PERIOD VISIT_OCCURENCE VISIT_DETAIL CONDITION_OCCURRENCE DRUG_EXPOSURE If possible, we recommend loading all of the medication data. For sites that are building de novo OMOP tables, selective loading should focus on cardiovascular drugs that fall under the following ATC classes: alimentary tract and metabolism, blood and blood forming organs, and cardiovascular systems. PROCEDURE_OCCURRENCE If possible, we recommend loading all procedures. In particular, we would like sites to confirm the loading of these procedures. DEVICE_EXPOSURE MEASUREMENT If possible, we recommend loading all of measurement data, including vitals. For sites that are building de novo OMOP tables, lists of high value labs and vitals will be forthcoming for selective loading. See details for loading echocardiogram data below. OBSERVATION DEATH NOTE We recommend loading notes for echocardiogram, cardiac cath, and ECG if possible. Our initial priority will be loading echo notes locally. At Northwestern, we have used both an internally-developed text de-identification tool as well as an open source tool from Stanford called TiDE.

Most of the echo variables could be matched to appropriate LOINC code(s). For variables where suitable standard codes were not found, custom vocabulary and custom concept mappings were created for capturing those values.The echo measurements should be able to be linked to echos in the PROCEDURE_OCCURRENCE table. For left ventricular ejection fraction, we recommend mapping the value in the echo reported by the echocardiographer to the most appropriate LOINC code. If the method of measurement is unknown, then use LOINC Code 8806-2, Left ventricular Ejection fraction by 2D echo.
